"""Resolve "topic #N" (or a title fragment) against the newest podcast-topic-discovery shortlist.

Why this is a script: the Signal chat session is long-lived and carries old shortlists in its
context, so a model resolving "#1" from memory picked 2026-09-29's #1 on 2026-10-01. Prose in
the skill ("read the newest file") was skipped; a non-zero exit is not. The shortlist is
delivered by signal-send, outside the chat session, so the file is the only record of today's.

Usage: resolve_topic.py <N | title fragment> [--no-log]
Prints the shortlist's date, the chosen item's title, its source URLs and its description.
Exit 1: no shortlist, shortlist older than 1 day, or no match. Exit 2: ambiguous title.
Logs the pick for preference-mining (skip with --no-log).
