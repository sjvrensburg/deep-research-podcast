# says so outright: "a poller that cannot interpret it still fires and still
# tells someone"). Until 2026-08-23 nothing here interpreted it, so a stopped or
# crashed research run -- which never reached trigger_podcast() and therefore has
# no job at all -- took the full new-job path: acquire the ~8 GiB vibevoice
# lease, GET /api/podcasts/jobs/failed five times for five HTTP 500s over 40
# seconds, then release. Three costs, all real, all observed twice within
# fifteen minutes on 2026-08-23: an 8 GiB spike during a shutdown the operator
# had usually triggered *because* memory was tight; ~45 s added to every stop
# (the pipeline runs this synchronously); and a Signal message reading "I can't
# read its job status ... Check: .../jobs/failed", which sends someone to a URL
# that cannot ever work, about a job that never existed.
#
# Ahead of the lock as well as the lease: the lock key is derived from the job
# id, so every failed run in the system shares one "podcast-poller-failed.lock"

# ── The TTS server's lease lives here ────────────────────────────────────
# `vibevoice-api` is on-demand as of 2026-08-23 and every consumer starts it
# AND tears it down (operator's instruction that day). This poller is where a
# podcast job's teardown belongs: it is the only thing that outlives the agent
# turn and knows when the episode is actually finished. The trap covers every
# exit path — success, hard ceiling, the duplicate-poller bail-out above, and a
# `systemctl --user stop` of this transient unit.
#
# Teardown goes through the lease helper, never a bare `systemctl stop`: a
# voice message or a second episode can be synthesizing at the same moment, and
# the refcount is what stops this from cutting their audio off mid-clip.
# Passing $$ lets the helper prune this lease if the poller is killed outright.
#
# ── OFF BY DEFAULT SINCE 2026-09-24: podcasts are Kokoro now. ──
# The operator moved podcasts from VibeVoice to Kokoro (preferred on listening;
# ~2x faster; CPU-only and always on in the open-notebook compose stack, so no
# lease and no GPU). Until then every episode took this lease, Kokoro ones
# included, "a spurious ~8 GiB for the life of one episode" -- acceptable while
# VibeVoice was the default, pure waste once it is not. VibeVoice stays for the
# voice-message skill, which leases it itself.
#
# Set PODCAST_VIBEVOICE_LEASE=1 in the poller's environment to get the old
# behaviour for a deliberate `_vibevoice`-profile run. Without it such a run
# fails at synthesis, because Open Notebook will not start vibevoice-api -- the
# same failure the lease was added to prevent, now opt-in rather than paid by
# every Kokoro job.
#

# elsewhere (or not at all): unset the path to something non-executable and
# the poller just logs a warning and manages nothing.

# source — it emits "Generating transcript for segment N/M".
#
# `--since "${START_TS}"`, NOT a fixed window. Fixed 30m/60m windows read log
# lines emitted BEFORE this poller existed, so a fresh poller reports the
# PREVIOUS episode's progress as its own until its job writes a first segment
# line. Observed 2026-08-17: a poller started at 17:23:21 announced
# "segment 5/7" one second later and sent that to Signal, while its job had not
# even finished generating an outline — 5/7 was the position of the job that had
# just been killed. Mid-run readings were correct; only the startup window lied,
# which is the worst case, since that is the reading a user takes as
# confirmation the job started properly.
#
# docker's --since accepts a Unix timestamp, so START_TS (set at line ~50) is a

# guard below actually hold, rather than relying on jobs never overlapping.
